    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time required for an algorithm to run as a function of the length of its input. It is commonly expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound on the time taken by an algorithm. A more efficient algorithm will have a lower time complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The amount of memory an algorithm needs to run is called <b>Space Complexity</b>. This is also typically measured using Big O notation, such as O(n) for an algorithm whose memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
